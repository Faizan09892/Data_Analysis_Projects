    "**SQLite :** - SQLite database is integrated with the application that accesses the database. The applications interact with the SQLite database read and write directly from the database files stored on disk.\n",
    "         \n",
    "- SQLite does NOT require a server to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Refer at https://www.sqlite.org/index.html\n",

    "**PANDAS :**\n",
    "    - Pandas provide high performance, fast, easy to use data structures and data analysis tools for manipulating numeric data and time series. Pandas is built on the numpy library and written in languages like Python, Cython, and C. In pandas, we can import data from various file formats like JSON, SQL, Microsoft Excel, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**NUMPY:**\n",
    "       - Numpy is an Python library,It is used for scientific computing in python.It contains a collection of tools and techniques that can be used to solve on computers with mathematical model of problems.\n",
    "       - High performance and multi-dimensional areay objects.\n",
    "       - High level mathematical functions.\n",
    "       - matrices\n",
    "       \n",
    "       \n",
    " ### Data Visualizations\n",
    " - Data Visualization is the graphic representation of data. It converts a huge dataset into small graphs, thus aids in data analysis and predictions\n",
    "       \n",
    "**MATPLOTLIB**\n",
    "- It is a Python library used for plotting graphs with the help of other libraries like Numpy and Pandas. It is a powerful tool for visualizing data in Python. It is used for creating statical interferences and plotting 2D graphs of arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "**SEABORN:**\n",
    "- It is also a Python library used for plotting graphs with the help of Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy. It is built on the roof of Matplotlib and is considered as a superset of the Matplotlib library. It helps in visualizing univariate and bivariate data"
